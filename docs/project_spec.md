# Project specification

### **Overview**

The focus of this take home is around **ingesting a CSV file** which contains a mock example of a
Trustpilot Review dataset. The goal is **loading the data into a database** (of your choice) to be
used downstream by the rest of the business **via an API**. Hint hint - some of the data is dirty and
will require cleaning.
Requirements:

1. ~~I~~ngest the Reviews CSV file provided into a table in a database.
2. Programmatically clean up the data if needed.
3. Create an API that enables our users to perform CRUD operations.
4. Create Tests for all code
5. Implement logging
6. Submit your solution via Github.

### **What Are We Looking For?**

We want to give you the opportunity to show off your software engineering skills and coding best
practices.

Examples of areas we care about:
- Unit testing
- Readability (Code comments, etc)
- Thought Process
- Design Choices
- Performance Considerations
- Productionisation

The submission is language agnostic so please pick the language that you feel most
comfortable with, we use a selection of languages (Python, Typescript, Java) and we are open
for you to choose other languages too.

Be prepared to **discuss your solution** and **how you could extend it**, as well as how you may run
the application in a **production environment**.

How Long Should It Take?
This should take somewhere between 2 and 4 hours. Please be prepared to explain and
discuss your solution in the technical interview.

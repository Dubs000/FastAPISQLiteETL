# Integration Testing Strategy

This document outlines the integration testing strategy for the Reviews API. The aim is to comprehensively test all aspects of the API, ensuring that each component functions as expected and interacts correctly with the other parts of the system.

## Test Environment

- Tests will be conducted against an **in memory database** to avoid impacting production data.
- Ensure that the testing environment mirrors the production environment as closely as possible.

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Read All Reviews (Empty State Check)

- **Endpoint**: `GET /reviews`
- **Objective**: Confirm that the table is initially empty.
- **Expectation**: The response should indicate no reviews are present or return an empty list.

### 2. Insert Reviews

- **Endpoint**: `POST /reviews/insert`
- **Objective**: Test the insertion of new reviews and retrieve their IDs.
- **Data**: Multiple review records with varied data.
- **Expectation**: Successful insertion response including the IDs of inserted reviews.

### 3. Select Reviews with Conditions

- **Endpoint**: `GET /reviews/select`
- **Objective**: Validate the query functionality with filters, highlighting the WHERE clause.
- **Data**: Specific conditions/filters based on previously inserted reviews.
- **Expectation**: Response matches the inserted reviews based on the provided conditions.

### 4. Update Specific Reviews

- **Endpoint**: `PATCH /reviews/update`
- **Objective**: Test the update functionality on specific review records.
- **Data**: Update payload for specific fields in selected reviews.
- **Expectation**: Successful update confirmation; subsequent queries should reflect these updates.

### 5. Delete Reviews

- **Endpoint**: `DELETE /reviews`
- **Objective**: Validate the deletion functionality for specific reviews.
- **Data**: IDs or conditions that target specific reviews for deletion.
- **Expectation**: Confirmation of deletion; deleted reviews should no longer be retrievable.

### 6. Read All Reviews (Final State Check)

- **Endpoint**: `GET /reviews`
- **Objective**: Confirm the final state of the data after all CRUD operations.
- **Expectation**: The response should reflect the remaining data after updates and deletions.

## Additional Testing Considerations

- **Error Handling**: Include scenarios that test the API's response to invalid inputs or requests.
- **Response Validation**: Verify not only the presence/absence of data but also the correctness of data formats and values.
- **Cleanup**: After testing, reset the database to its initial state to maintain a clean test environment.

## Automation and Tools

- Integration tests will be automated using pytest.
- Regular execution of these tests will be scheduled to ensure continuous validation of the API functionality.

## Conclusion

This integration testing strategy is designed to ensure that all components of the Reviews API work harmoniously and as expected. By rigorously testing each aspect of the system, we aim to maintain a reliable, robust, and efficient service.
